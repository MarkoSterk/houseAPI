# House API

RESTFul API built using Python (Flask) and MongoDB.
It includes a somewhat hack-ish Schema validation for users and houses, signup for users, password updates, reset passwords with token identification, JWT authentication, file uploads and the ability to modify users and houses. 
This app could serve as a backbone for a house selling web service. 

This API uses an outdated version of the MongoDB Schema validation. If you decide to use it you should update to the newer version which can be found among my repositories.

The API can simply be tested with the provided POSTMAN configs.
