# House API

RESTFul API built using Python (Flask) and MongoDB.
It includes a somewhat hack-ish Schema validation for users and houses, signup for users, password updates, reset passwords with token identification, JWT authentication, file uploads and the ability to modify users and houses. 
This app could serve as a backbone for a house selling web service.
